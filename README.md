# BCHtools.cash — Cypherpunk Tool Universe

A living collection of independent Bitcoin Cash tools.

Live: **https://bchtools.cash**

## What this is

Not a generic crypto directory. A multi-page experience:

- **Home** — transmission / orientation
- **The Tools** — full filterable collection
- **Finished** — ideas that became real
- **In the Lab** — active experiments
- **Awaiting Signal** — projects that need a push
- **Highlighted** — editorial picks
- **CASHRUSH** — play first, discover the rest later
- **Fund Me Tools** — ongoing support, no deadline
- **About** — independent building

## Architecture

Static HTML + shared CSS/JS. No framework. No backend.
